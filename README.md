# investment_bond_calculator
This Python script allows you to calculate the returns on an investment or the repayment amount for a home loan based on user inputs. It provides options for calculating both simple and compound interest.

# Usage
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone the repository or download the investment_bond_calculator.py file to your local machine.
- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the 'investment_bond_calculator.py' file is located.
- Run the script using the command python investment_bond_calculator.py.
- Follow the prompts to select the type of calculation (investment or bond) and provide the required inputs.
- The script will perform the calculation and display the result.

# How It Works
- The script presents a program menu with two options: "investment" and "bond".
- If the user selects "investment", they will be prompted to enter the amount of money being deposited, the interest rate (as a percentage), and the number of years of investment.
- Based on the user's input, the script calculates and displays the returns on the investment, either using simple interest or compound interest formulas.
- If the user selects "bond", they will be prompted to enter the present value of the house, the number of months for repayment, and the monthly interest rate.
- Based on the user's input, the script calculates and displays the monthly bond repayment amount.
- If the user selects an option other than "investment" or "bond", the script displays an error message.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
